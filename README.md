# Hi

This is a description file of this project.

To get the site up and running correctly you need to download [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/). So, download it, open terminal and write command `node .` in there. If you are lazy enough to not enter this simple phrase that consists out of 6 characters, then just start `start.bat` file in main folder on windows or `start.sh` on linux.
